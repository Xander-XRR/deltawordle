Hey ya'll, Sco- er, i mean Xander here!

If you wanna add your own Words to the Words-list, simply put it in the file matching the number of characters in said Words!

for example:
    'SANS' belongs in 4.txt
    'RALSEI' belongs in 6.txt

Simple as that!

Also, keep in mind, ALL WORDS NEED TO BE UPPERCASE, AND NOT USE ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS OR NUMBERS

With that said, have fun and happy shitposting! :3
